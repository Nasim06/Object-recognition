# Object-recognition

Recognising objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset using an artificial neural network and a convolutional neural network. 
The notebook uses both of these techniques to recognise images and put them in one of the ten categories. 
After the neural network has been trained they are then tested on a test set and an accuracy score is generated.
